### Testing Agent (2025-05-31):
Completed focused backend testing of the Cloud Access Visualizer with emphasis on graph connectivity and Top 5 Risky Users functionality:

1. **Graph Connectivity Testing** (/api/search/{email}):
   - ✅ Successfully tested with a high-risk user (andrewwatts@rivera.info)
   - ✅ Graph data structure is properly implemented with nodes and edges
   - ✅ User node (center) is correctly connected to all provider nodes (3 connections)
   - ✅ Provider nodes are connected to service nodes (3 connections)
   - ✅ Service nodes are connected to resource nodes (3 connections)
   - ✅ No disconnected nodes found in the graph
   - ✅ All edges have proper labels
   - ✅ Graph hierarchy follows the expected pattern: User → Provider → Service → Resource

2. **Enhanced Risky Users API** (/api/users/risky?limit=5):
   - ✅ Successfully returns exactly 5 users sorted by risk score
   - ✅ Top user has 100% risk score with proper risk reason
   - ✅ All required fields are present: user_email, user_name, department, risk_score, risk_reason, providers, total_resources
   - ✅ Provider arrays are correctly formatted and populated
   - ✅ Resource counts are accurate

3. **Authentication & Error Handling**:
   - ✅ Endpoints properly require authentication
   - ❌ Invalid token handling needs improvement (endpoints don't properly reject invalid tokens)
   - ❌ Edge case handling for non-existent users needs improvement (returns empty graph instead of 404)

Overall, the core functionality for graph connectivity and risky users is working correctly. The graph generation algorithm produces properly connected graphs with the expected hierarchy and relationships. The risky users endpoint returns the correct data with all required fields. There are minor issues with authentication error handling that could be improved but don't affect the core functionality.
