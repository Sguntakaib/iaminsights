# Testing Protocol for Full-Stack Application

## Communication Protocol with Testing Sub-Agent

### Main Agent Guidelines:
- MUST always READ this protocol before invoking testing agents
- MUST update test findings after each test run
- MUST communicate any code changes clearly to testing agents
- NEVER fix issues already resolved by testing agents

### Testing Agent Protocol:
- Update test_result.md with findings and fixes
- Focus on CRITICAL issues only (auth, API errors, major UI bugs)
- Do not fix minor styling or non-functional issues
- Provide clear summary with git diff when available
- Main agent should validate work before proceeding

## Backend Testing Protocol
Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for backend testing with the following instructions:
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Check authentication flows
- Verify database operations
- Test error handling
- Ensure all CRUD operations work

## Frontend Testing Protocol  
Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for frontend testing with the following instructions:
- Test UI interactions and component rendering
- Verify frontend-backend integration
- Check form submissions and data display
- Test navigation and routing
- Validate error states and loading states

## Incorporate User Feedback
- User feedback takes priority over automated testing results
- Always ask user for confirmation on major fixes
- If user reports functionality working, trust their feedback over test results
- Focus on user's priority issues first

## Critical Rules
- DO NOT test frontend without explicit user permission
- ALWAYS ask user before frontend testing using ask_human tool
- NEVER modify test_result.md unnecessarily
- Focus testing on NEW functionality and CRITICAL issues only

# Test Result Summary

## User Problem Statement
The user requested two main enhancements to the Cloud Access Visualizer:

1. **Okta Data Enhancement**: Add `application_name` and `application_access_type` fields to Okta resources in the JSON structure, and ensure these map properly in the graph visualization as okta > app > access hierarchy.

2. **UI Enhancement**: Replace the current sample users display with a dynamic "Top 10 Risky Users" list on the Search/Visualize page, showing:
   - User email
   - Department 
   - Risk score
   - Risk reason
   - Each item should link to detailed user view

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Backend Changes Completed:
1. **Enhanced CloudResource Model**: Added `application_name` and `application_access_type` optional fields to the CloudResource model for Okta-specific application data
2. **Updated Graph Generation**: Modified `generate_graph_data` function to create proper okta > app > access hierarchy for Okta resources while maintaining standard structure for other providers
3. **Enhanced GraphNode Types**: Updated GraphNode type definition to include "application" and "access" node types

### ✅ Frontend Changes Completed:
1. **Top Risky Users Display**: Replaced sample users section with dynamic "Top Risky Users" component that:
   - Shows top risky users from analytics data
   - Displays user email, department, risk score, and risk reason
   - Uses color-coded risk levels (red: ≥80, yellow: ≥60, green: <60)
   - Includes loading states and empty states
   - Each user item is clickable and navigates to detailed user view
2. **Added Required Icons**: Imported ChevronRight and ShieldCheck icons from lucide-react

## Backend Testing Results

### ✅ Successful Tests:
- CloudResource model accepts new Okta application fields
- Graph generation logic updated for okta > app > access hierarchy
- GraphNode types enhanced with new node types
- Sample data includes Okta resources with application fields
- Standard providers maintain existing resource structure

### ⚠️ Authentication Issue:
- `/api/users/risky` endpoint exists but requires authentication
- Testing was limited due to auth token issues
- Backend functionality appears correctly implemented

## Current Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Enhanced Okta data model and graph generation implemented
- ✅ **Frontend**: Top risky users UI component implemented  
- ⚠️ **Testing**: Backend testing completed with auth limitations
- ❓ **Next**: Awaiting user feedback and frontend testing permission

## Next Steps
1. **User Validation**: User should test the enhanced functionality
2. **Frontend Testing**: Only if user requests it
3. **Authentication Fix**: If user reports auth issues
